## Prompt

I want to submit a conference talk proposal for PyConZA.
PyConZA is the annual gathering of the South African community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. PyConZA is organized by the Python community for the community. Talk slots are 30 minutes long.
A wide variety of talk topics are accepted. The only hard requirement is that your talk must be related to Python.
I want to submit a talk under one of their main categories: Testing code or infrastructure.
More specifically, I want to talk about a case where we created synthetic data to test data pipelines. We used python with some statistical methods to create realistic synthetic data for different use cases. We also used Python packages like Faker and SDV for increased realism of the synthetic data. Finally, to load the synthetic data into a postgres database, we used flyway for repeatable deployments. This topic could be quite an interesting applied engineering talk on how we did and used data testing. One idea for a talk title can be something funny like "How to build a data pipeline without data"

Now use this information to write an abstract for the talk and give the talk an appropriate title

## Answer

Title: How to build a data pipeline without data: A case study of synthetic data generation and testing with Python

Abstract:

Data pipelines are essential for transforming, validating, and loading data from various sources into a target database or data warehouse. However, building and testing data pipelines can be challenging when the real data is not available, either due to privacy issues, technical limitations, or simply because the data is not yet collected. How can we ensure that our data pipelines are robust and reliable without having access to the actual data?

In this talk, we will share our experience of creating synthetic data to test data pipelines using Python. We will demonstrate how we used some statistical methods and Python packages such as Faker and SDV to generate realistic synthetic data for different use cases, such as customer profiles, transactions, and time series. We will also show how we used Flyway to load the synthetic data into a Postgres database and perform repeatable deployments. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using synthetic data for testing data pipelines, as well as some best practices and tips for creating and using synthetic data effectively.

This talk is aimed at intermediate-level Python developers who are interested in learning more about synthetic data generation and testing techniques for data pipelines. The talk will include code examples and live demos of the tools and methods we used. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how to build a data pipeline without data using Python.
