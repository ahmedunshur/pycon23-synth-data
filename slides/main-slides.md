## 🛠️ What is a data pipeline?

- A data pipeline is a series of operations used to extract, load, transform, validate, or write data
- From various sources into a target file system, database, or data warehouse

---

## 🔍 Data pipelines without real data

- Sometimes, we may not have access to the real data that we want to process in our data pipeline.
- It could be:
  - Sensitive or confidential and can't be shared
  - Not yet collected or available
  - Too large or complex to handle for initial testing

---

## 🔍 Data pipelines without real data

- Without real data, it is challenging to:
  - Design the data model and schema
  - Develop the data extract, transform, and load (ETL) logic
  - Test the functionality and performance of the data pipeline
  - Debug and troubleshoot errors and issues

---

## 🧪 Synthetic data to test data pipelines

- Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics the characteristics and behavior of real data
- Synthetic data can help us to test our data pipelines by:
  - Providing realistic sample data
  - Allowing  control of the size, shape, and distribution of the data
  - Enabling simulations of different scenarios and edge cases
  - Reducing the risk of exposing sensitive or confidential information

---

## 💃 Demo

- In this talk, I'll show you how you can create synthetic data
- Using a Python package called Faker
- And how to use Flyway to load the synthetic data into a Postgres database for repeatable deployments

---

## What are the benefits and challenges of using synthetic data for testing data pipelines?

- Some of the benefits of using synthetic data are:
  - It can speed up the development and testing process
  - It can increase the coverage and quality of testing
  - It can improve the scalability and reliability of the data pipeline
- Some of the challenges of using synthetic data are:
  - It may not capture all the nuances and variations of real data
  - It may introduce biases or errors in the synthetic data generation process
  - It may require additional effort and resources to create and maintain synthetic data

---

## What are some best practices and tips for creating and using synthetic data effectively?

- Some of the best practices and tips are:
  - Define the scope and purpose of your synthetic data
  - Use existing tools and libraries to generate synthetic data
  - Validate and verify your synthetic data against your real data schema and business rules
  - Document your synthetic data generation process and code
  - Keep your synthetic data up-to-date with your real data changes

---

## Summary

- In this talk, we learned how to build a data pipeline without real data using Python
- We discussed the challenges of building and testing data pipelines without real data
- We showed how we used synthetic data to test our data pipelines
- We demonstrated how we used Python packages such as Faker to generate realistic synthetic data
- We also showed how we used Flyway to load the synthetic data into a Postgres database
