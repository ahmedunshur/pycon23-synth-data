A case study of synthetic data generation and testing with Python

---

## About me

- I am a Python developer with X years of experience in building data pipelines
- I work at Y, a company that does Z
- You can find me on Twitter, GitHub, or email

## Outline

- What is a data pipeline and why do we need it?
- What are the challenges of building and testing data pipelines without real data?
- How can we use synthetic data to test data pipelines?
- What are the tools and methods we used to generate and load synthetic data using Python?
- What are the benefits and challenges of using synthetic data for testing data pipelines?
- What are some best practices and tips for creating and using synthetic data effectively?

## What is a data pipeline and why do we need it?

- A data pipeline is a process of moving, transforming, validating, and loading data from various sources into a target database or data warehouse
- Data pipelines enable us to:
  - Integrate data from different sources and formats
  - Perform data quality checks and transformations
  - Load data into a centralized location for analysis and reporting
  - Automate and schedule data processing tasks

---

## What are the challenges of building and testing data pipelines without real data?

- Sometimes, we may not have access to the real data that we want to process in our data pipeline, either because:
  - The data is sensitive or confidential and cannot be shared
  - The data is not yet collected or available
  - The data is too large or complex to handle
- Without real data, we may face difficulties in:
  - Designing the data model and schema
  - Developing the data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) logic
  - Testing the functionality and performance of the data pipeline
  - Debugging and troubleshooting errors and issues

---

## How can we use synthetic data to test data pipelines?

- Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics the characteristics and behavior of real data
- Synthetic data can help us to test our data pipelines by:
  - Providing us with realistic and representative sample data
  - Allowing us to control the size, shape, and distribution of the data
  - Enabling us to simulate different scenarios and edge cases
  - Reducing the risk of exposing sensitive or confidential information

---

## What are the tools and methods we used to generate and load synthetic data using Python?

- In this talk, we will share our experience of creating synthetic data for different use cases, such as customer profiles, transactions, and time series
- We will demonstrate how we used some statistical methods and Python packages such as Faker to generate realistic synthetic data
- We will also show how we used Flyway to load the synthetic data into a Postgres database and perform repeatable deployments

---

## What are the benefits and challenges of using synthetic data for testing data pipelines?

- Some of the benefits of using synthetic data are:
  - It can speed up the development and testing process
  - It can increase the coverage and quality of testing
  - It can improve the scalability and reliability of the data pipeline
- Some of the challenges of using synthetic data are:
  - It may not capture all the nuances and variations of real data
  - It may introduce biases or errors in the synthetic data generation process
  - It may require additional effort and resources to create and maintain synthetic data

---

## What are some best practices and tips for creating and using synthetic data effectively?

- Some of the best practices and tips are:
  - Define the scope and purpose of your synthetic data
  - Use existing tools and libraries to generate synthetic data
  - Validate and verify your synthetic data against your real data schema and business rules
  - Document your synthetic data generation process and code
  - Keep your synthetic data up-to-date with your real data changes

## Summary

- In this talk, we learned how to build a data pipeline without real data using Python
- We discussed the challenges of building and testing data pipelines without real data
- We showed how we used synthetic data to test our data pipelines
- We demonstrated how we used Python packages such as Faker to generate realistic synthetic data
- We also showed how we used Flyway to load the synthetic data into a Postgres database
